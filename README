Trakt Utilities

This Add-on improves XBMC to synchronise seen Movies / TVShows with Trakt (Trakt Account required).
More infos about Trakt: http://trakt.tv/

This add-on isn't a replacement for the official trakt add-on. It's an addition to it.
    
This is an open-source project.
I'll do my best, but the use is at own risk.

ATTENTION:
This Add-on needs library mode. All Movies / TVShows, that are not in library mode will be ignored.

Utilities:
    - Update Movie Collection:
        updates your trakt movie library (not the seen movies) with your xbmc collection
    
    - Sync seen Movies:
        synchronise seen movies between xbmc and trakt
        seen movies from xbmc will be set as seen on trakt
        seen movies from trakt will be set as seen on xbmc
        it don't sets movies as unseen
    
    - Update TV Show Collection:
        same like Update Movie Collection, but for TV Shows.
        
    - Sync seen TV Shows:
        same like Sync seen Movies, but for TV Shows.
        
    - Clean Movie Collection:
        this will remove deleted movies from the trakt collection (unlibrary, it will not set movies as unseen).
        ATTENTION:
        don't use this function, if you collect data about your DVDs, Blu-Rays, etc.
        this will unlibrary all movies on tract, that are not in the xbmc database
        
    - Clean TV Show Collection:
        same like Clean Movie Collection, but for TV Shows
        ATTENTION:
        don't use this function, if you collect data about your DVDs, Blu-Rays, etc.
        this will unlibrary all tvshows on trakt, that are not in the xbmc database

The Utilities for TV Shows only work, if your scraper is TVDB (http://thetvdb.com/).

Special Thanks to:
Justin Nemeth and Sean Rudford, for the great Trakt project.
