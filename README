Trakt Utilities Beta

Synchronise Movies / TVShows with Trakt (more infos and account creation: http://trakt.tv/).
This plugin isn't a replacement for the official trakt plugin. It's a supplement to the trakt plugin.
    
This is a Beta, every use is at own risk.

Utilities:
    - Update Movie Collection:
        updates your trakt movie library (not the seen movies) with your xbmc collection
    
    - Sync seen Movies:
        synchronise seen movies between xbmc and trakt
        seen movies from xbmc will be set as seen on trakt
        seen movies from trakt will be set as seen on xbmc
        it don't sets movies as unseen
    
    - Update TVShow Collection:
        same like Update Movie Collection, but for TVShows.
        
    - Sync seen TVShows:
        same like Sync seen Movies, but for TVShows.
        
    - Clean Movie Collection:
        this will remove deleted movies from the trakt collection (unlibrary, it will not set movies as unseen).
        ATTENTION:
        don't use this function, if you collect data about your DVDs, Blu-Rays, etc.
        this will unlibrary all movies, that are not listed in xbmc
        
    - Clean TVShow Collection:
        same like Clean Movie Collection, but for TVShows

The Utilities for TVShows only work yet, if your scraper is TVDB (http://thetvdb.com/).

Special Thanks to: Justin Nemeth and Sean Rudford, for the great Trakt project.

ToDo for future versions:
    - auto update (sorry, but yet you have to check for updates yourself)
    - option for silent sync at xbmc startup
